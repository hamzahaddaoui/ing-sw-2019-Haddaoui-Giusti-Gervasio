# UML files

In the deliveries/previous/uml folder there is the initial uml (of the model).

Deliveries/final/uml contains the final UMLs created, both in detailed version (one for the Server package, one for the Client package) and a summary version.

# JavaDoc & test

The generated Javadocs, as well as the test reports, are located in the deliveries/final folder.

# Application launch

The application is multi-platform, so it works properly on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

To start the Server, simply double click on Server.jar, located in the deliveries/final/jar folder (or type "java -jar Server.jar" from the terminal).

To start the GUI version of the client, just double click on Client.jar, located in the same folder as the Server (or type "java -jar Client.jar" from the terminal).

To start the client in the CLI version, it is necessary to type "java -jar Client.jar -cli" from the terminal.
